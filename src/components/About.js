        I'm a projecct coordinator at HCA, where I work for web development teams who run operations for our IT and software development for hospitals. After completing a full-stack bootcamp course at Vanderbilt, I'm looking to transition into a full-time web development role.

        When I'm not in front of a screen, you might find me cooking, making artwotk, taking photos or spending time with friends and family.
